# Bash Automation
Project Introduction: Bash Launch (Bash Scripting project). An CLI based project which automatically runs launch scripts of multiple applications according to selections by user.

## Problem: 
Opening fixed sites and applications after system shutdown or a new session is time consuming. 

## Solution: 
CLI menu driven options to open a batch of websites and applications at the same time for the chosen activity.

## Example:
If my chosen activity is DSA, then by choosing option 1, I can open chatGPT (brave)+ Intellij + LeetCode(Chrome) + other necessary sites and apps without having to open them separately. User's time is saved and their workflow is more streamlined. 

## Result:
1. CLI provides choices to user for launching applications. here the selected group of applications is related to DSA.
